# Sword of WiFinding
"In brightest day, in darkest night, no access point shall escape my sight!"

## Description
Forged in the factories of Shenzhen, China the Sword of WiFinding points the way to the specified access point and plays a tune when the RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) dBm is at or near full strength.

## Parts List:
* 1 Particle Photon ( https://store.particle.io/products/photon )
* 1 LED pixel sword, 5234 ( http://www.abctradinginc.com/categories?c=sword )
* 4 white LEDs (A drawer in my basement)
* 10 220 ohm resistors (A drawer in my basement)
* 1 100uF capacitor (A drawer in my basement)

## Sword Build
The sword runs off of three AA batteries, has an piezo speaker a power switch and 6 six flashing multi color LEDs. It's got a circuit board that drives the light and contains the sound sample chip. If I had more ambition I'd dissolve the blob of epoxy to figure out what it is, but I'm not going to use it so into the garbage bin it goes. I purchased another unit as a spare, and it's internal wiring was different. It had no piezo speaker and five flasher LED's. Depending on what day or what factory the unit was built in, you may end up needing to supply your own piezo speaker and extra LED's
